        body: `Dilithium is a post-quantum digital signature algorithm designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers. It was selected as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization Process to replace traditional digital signature schemes like RSA and ECDSA, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks.

Dilithium is based on lattice-based cryptography, a field of cryptography that relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems related to high-dimensional lattices. These problems are believed to be resistant even to quantum computers.`,
